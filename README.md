What are branches?
A branch in Git is a pointer to a specific commit in your project's history.
It allows you to create parallel lines of development without affecting the main branch.
Why use branches?
Experimentation: Create branches to try out new features or ideas without risking the main codebase.
Collaboration: Different teams or developers can work on separate branches simultaneously.
Bug fixing: Isolate bug fixes on a branch to avoid disrupting the main development.
Releases: Create branches for specific releases or versions of your project.
Common branch types:
Main branch (usually called master or main): The primary branch where the stable version of your project resides.
Development branch: A branch for active development and integration of new features.
Feature branches: Short-lived branches created for specific features.
Bugfix branches: Branches created to address specific bugs.
Release branches: Branches created for preparing a specific release.
Branching strategies:
Gitflow: A popular workflow with distinct branches for development, releases, and maintenance.
GitHub Flow: A simpler approach with a single main branch and feature branches for development.
Branch commands:
git branch: List existing branches.
git branch <branch-name>: Create a new branch.
git checkout <branch-name>: Switch to a different branch.
git merge <branch-name>: Merge changes from one branch into another. Â  
git rebase <branch-name>: Apply changes from one branch onto another.
By understanding Git branches and their effective use, you can streamline your development process, collaborate more efficiently, and manage your project's history effectively.
